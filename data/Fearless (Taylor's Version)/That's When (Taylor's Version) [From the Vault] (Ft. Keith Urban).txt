You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
And you said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
Mm, mm
I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (Through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
And I said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"
That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
(That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate)
That's when I miss you, that's when I want you
(That's when, when I see your face)
That's when I love you, that's when

I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (Never)
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (Never)
Be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (Never)
(So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same (We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
